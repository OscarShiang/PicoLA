# PicoLA

A compact C++ library for doing linear algebra computations

## Requirements

### macOS

There are few packages need to be installed before building the project.

We recommend macOS users to install them with [`Homebrew`](https://brew.sh/).

After setting up Homebrew on your machine, you can install the packages with
the following command:

```bash
$ brew install cmake ninja clang-format
```
